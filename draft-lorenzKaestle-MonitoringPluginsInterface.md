--- abstract

This document aims to document the Monitoring Plugin Interface, a standard more or less
strictly implemented by different network monitoring solutions.
Implementers and Users of network monitoring solutions, monitoring plugins and libraries can use
this as a reference point as to how these programs interface with each other.

# Introduction

With the emergence of NetSaint/Nagios at the latest, this system and their successors/clones
have relied on a loose group of programs called "Monitoring Plugins" to do the lower level
task of actually determining the state of particular entity or conduct measurements of certain
values.

This document shall help users and especially developers of those programs as a basis
on how they should be implemented, how they should work and how they should behave.
It encourages the standardization of libraries, Monitoring Plugins and Monitoring Systems,
to reduce the cognitive load on users, administrators and developers, if they work with
different implementations.

These guidelines aim to be mostly as general as possible and not to assume anticipate a special
implementation detail, e.g. the programming language, the install mechanism or the monitoring
system which executes the Monitoring Plugin.

# Security Considerations

Special security considerations are hard to define regarding this topic. Regarding the implementation
of this interface, the usual programming security considerations should apply (e.g. sanitize inputs),
but the risks and problems regarding security are dependent on the specific implementation and usage.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
